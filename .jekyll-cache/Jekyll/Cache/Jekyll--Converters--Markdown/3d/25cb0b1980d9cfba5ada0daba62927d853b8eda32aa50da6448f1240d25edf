<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>CRISPR-BETS</strong> (<strong>CRISPR</strong>-<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>E</strong>diting <strong>T</strong>o <strong>S</strong>top codon) is developed for designing gRNA to knockout gene by CRISPR base editing system. CRISPR-BETS has both online and desktop version, which are integrated into a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and compatible with major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Guide RNAs can be designed easily without any environment installation. Users can complete the analysis with a simple mouse click. Results will display with detailed information and fancy images, which are able to be downloaded. Moreover, CRISPR-BETS allows instant check the gRNA specificity.</p>
