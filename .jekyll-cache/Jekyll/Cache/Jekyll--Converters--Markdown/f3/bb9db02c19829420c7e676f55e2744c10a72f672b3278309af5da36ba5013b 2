<p>Rice, a staple food with tropical/subtropical origination, is susceptible to cold stress, one of the major con- straints on its yield and distribution. Asian cultivated rice consists of two subspecies with diverged chilling tolerance to adapt to different environments. The mechanism underlying this divergence remains obscure with a few known factors, including membrane protein CHILLING-TOLERANCE DIVERGENCE 1 (COLD1). Here, we reveal a vitamin E-vitamin K1 sub-network responsible for chilling tolerance divergence through global analyses. Rice genome regions responsible for tolerance divergence are identified with chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). Comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of chilling- tolerant CSSL4-1 and parent lines uncovered a vitamin E-vitamin K1 sub-network in chloroplast with tocoph- erol (vitamin E) mediating chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. COLD1, located in the substitution segment in CSSL4-1, is confirmed as its upstream regulator by transgenic material analysis. Our work uncovers a pathway downstream of COLD1, through which rice modulates chilling tolerance for thermal adaptation, with potential utility in crop improvement.</p>
