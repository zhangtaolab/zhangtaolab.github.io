About the Lab
===============

<font size="5">Our laboratory is mainly engaged in the following researches.</font>
<br>

### 1. Cis-regulatory DNA Elements Identification
Cis-regulatory DNA elements (CRMs) control the expression of genes during specific developmental stages or under various biotic and abiotic stresses. Cis-regulatory elements can be identified based on their unique molecular signatures associated with open chromatin. Identification and characterization of CRM will be essential for us to understand plant stress biology, such enhancers will also become a key resource to improve the tissue specificity and transcription levels of transgenes for crop improvement.

### 2. Oligo-FISH Probe Design
Oligo probes designed from conserved DNA sequences from one species can be used among genetically related species, allowing comparative cytogenetic mapping of these species. The advances with synthetic oligo probes will significantly expand the applications of FISH especially in non-model plant species. Recent achievements and future applications of FISH and oligo-FISH are discussed.

### 3. CRISPR/Cas Genome Editing System
CRISPR technology is a simple yet powerful tool for editing genomes. It allows researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. This technology paly a critical role for improving crops.
