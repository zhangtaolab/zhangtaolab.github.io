An automatic calculation and visualization tool for high-throughput CRISPR genome-editing data analysis.

[Commandline(CLI) version](https://github.com/zhangtaolab/CRISPRMatch)
[GUI version](https://github.com/zhangtaolab/CRISPRMatchGUI)

## Introduction

**CRISPRMatch**, an automatic stand-alone toolkit based on python script to process the high-throughput genome-editing data of CRISPR nuclease transformed protoplasts by integrating analysis steps like mapping reads and normalizing reads count, calculating mutation frequency (deletion and insertion), evaluating efficiency and accuracy of genome-editing, and visualizing the results (tables and figures). Both of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1 nucleases are supported by CRISPRMatch toolkit. A graphical user interface(GUI) version of CRISPRMatch has also been deployed.
