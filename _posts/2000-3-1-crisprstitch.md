## Introduction

**CrisprStitch** CrisprStitch is designed to integrate analysis steps including mapping reads, calculating mutation frequency, evaluating the efficiency of genome-editing systems, and outputting visualized results. All functional parts are coded by typescripts. CrisprStitch is able to apply as a website or a downloadable desktop app created by electron. Both website and desktop app are perform series of calculations on the userâ€™s local computer side, rather than remote servers, which is beneficial for file size limits, network cosuming and analysis speed.
