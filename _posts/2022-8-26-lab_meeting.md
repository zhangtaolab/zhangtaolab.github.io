### Abstract:

Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling has been identified from the ligand BRs sensed by the receptor Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1) to the final activation of Brassinozole Resistant 1/bri1 EMS-Suppressor 1 through a series of transduction events. Extensive studies have been conducted to characterize the role of BR signaling in various biological processes. Our previous study has shown that Excess Microsporocytes 1 (EMS1) and BRI1 control different aspects of plant growth and development via conserved intracellular signaling.
Here, we reveal that another receptor, NILR1, can complement the bri1 mutant in the absence of BRs, indicating a pathway that resembles BR signaling activated by NILR1. Genetic analysis confirms the intracellular domains of NILR1, BRI1 and EMS1 have a common signal output.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that NILR1 and BRI1 share the coreceptor BRI1 Associated Kinase 1 and substrate BSKs. Notably, the NILR1-mediated downstream pathway is conserved across land plants.
In summary, we provide evidence for the signaling cascade of NILR1, suggesting pan-brassinosteroid signaling initiated by a group of distant receptor–ligand pairs in land plants.
