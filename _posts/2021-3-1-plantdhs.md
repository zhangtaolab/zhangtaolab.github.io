PlantDHS: a database for DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in plants.

[Go to](http://plantdhs.org/)

## Introduction

**PlantDHS** is a plant DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) database that integrates histone modification, RNA sequencing, nucleosome positioning/occupancy, transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), and genomic sequence within an easily navigated user interface. DHSs are indicative of all CREs, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and transcription factor binding sites.  
PlantDHS provides a platform to predict all CREs associated with individual genes from three model plant species, including *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Brachypodium distachyon* and rice (*Oryza sativa*).
