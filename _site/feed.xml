        <title>A uORF Represses the Transcription Factor AtHB1 in Aerial Tissues to Avoid a Deleterious Phenotype</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in its 5′ untranslated region. This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (Zea mays) homolog repressed the translation of the main open reading frame in cis, independent of the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost, indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants transformed with the native AtHB1 promoter driving AtHB1 expression did not show differential phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly, short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we propose that the uncontrolled expression of AtHB1 is deleterious for the plant and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enhancing rice grain production by manipulating the naturally evolved cis-regulatory element-containing inverted repeat sequence of OsREM20</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grain number per panicle (GNP) is an important agronomic trait that contributes to rice grain yield. Despite its importance in rice breeding, the molecular mechanism underlying GNP regulation remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a previously unrecognized regulatory gene that controls GNP in rice, Oryza sativa REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM 20 (OsREM20), which encodes a B3 domain transcription factor. Through genetic analysis and transgenic validation we found that genetic variation in the CArG box-containing inverted repeat (IR) sequence of the OsREM20 promoter alters its expression level and contributes to GNP variation among rice varieties. Furthermore, we revealed that the IR sequence regulates OsREM20 expression by affecting the direct binding of OsMADS34 to the CArG box within the IR sequence. Interestingly, the divergent pOsREM20IR and pOsREM20ΔIR alleles were found to originate from different Oryza rufipogon accessions, and were independently inherited into the japonica and indica subspecies, respectively, during domestication. Importantly, we demonstrated that IR sequence variations in the OsREM20 promoter can be utilized for germplasm improvement through either genome editing or traditional breeding. Taken together, our study characterizes novel genetic variations responsible for GNP diversity in rice, reveals the underlying molecular mechanism in the regulation of agronomically important gene expression, and provides a promising strategy for improving rice production by manipulating the cis-regulatory element-containing IR sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Assessing genome-wide dynamic changes in enhancer activity during early mESC differentiation by FAIRE-STARR-seq</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into any given cell type and therefore represent a versatile model to study the link between gene regulation and differentiation. To quantitatively assess the dynamics of enhancer activity during the early stages of murine ESC differentiation, we analyzed accessible genomic regions using STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay. This resulted in a genome-wide quantitative map of active mESC enhancers, in pluripotency and during the early stages of differentiation. We find that only a minority of accessible regions is active and that such regions are enriched near promoters, characterized by specific chromatin marks, enriched for distinct sequence motifs, and modeling shows that active regions can be predicted from sequence alone. Regions that change their activity upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation are more prevalent at distal intergenic regions when compared to constitutively active enhancers. Further, analysis of differentially active enhancers verified the contribution of individual TF motifs toward activity and inducibility as well as their role in regulating endogenous genes. Notably, the activity of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) occupied regions can either increase or decrease upon the addition of its ligand, retinoic acid, with the direction of the change correlating with spacing and orientation of the RARα consensus motif and the co-occurrence of additional sequence motifs. Together, our genome-wide enhancer activity map elucidates features associated with enhancer activity levels, identifies regulatory regions disregarded by computational prediction tools, and provides a resource for future studies into regulatory elements in mESCs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quantitative regulation of Waxy expression by CRISPR/Cas9-based promoter and 5’UTR-intron editing improves grain quality in rice</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cereal crops, grain starches are composed of different proportions of amylose and amylopectin, which determine the cooking and eating qualities. The amylose synthesis is controlled by the Waxy (Wx) gene encoding a granule bound NDP-glucose- starch glucosyltransferase (Shure et al., 1983). In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the varied activities of natural Wx alleles regulate different amylose contents (AC), gel consistency (GC) and pasting viscosity of grain starches; these factors together influence the grain appearance, cooking/eating quality and starch physical characters (Zhang et al., 2019). Wxa is a strong allele mainly distributing in indica (an O. sativa subspecies) cultivars producing high ACs (25%–30%) (Wang et al., 1995). While Wxb, presenting mainly in japonica (another subspecies) cultivars, is a weak allele producing moderate ACs (15–18%) (Isshiki et al., 1998). Generally, rice grains with higher ACs and lower GC values have poor eating quality, while those with moderate ACs (15–20%) and higher GC values (60–80 mm) give better taste for most consumers. Using the successive backcrossing methods, Wxb can be introgressed into indica varieties to improve the grain quality. However, the traditional breeding methods are time consuming and difficult to break close linkage drags with undesirable traits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nucleolar histone deacetylases HDT1, HDT2 and HDT3 regulate plant reproductive development</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleolus is a membrane-less organelle where ribosomes are assembled and rRNAs transcribed and processed. The assembled ribosomes composed of ribosomal proteins and rRNAs synthesize proteins for cell survival. In plants, the loss of nucleolar ribosomal proteins often causes gametophytically or embryonically lethality. The amount of rRNAs are under stringent regulation according to demand and partially switched off by epigenetic modifications. However, the molecular mechanism for the selective activation or silencing is still unclear, and the transcriptional coordination of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins is also unknown. Here we report the critical role of three Arabidopsis nucleolar protein HDT1, HDT2 and HDT3 in fertility and transcription of rDNAs and rRNA processing-related genes through histone acetylation. This study highlights the important roles of transcriptional repression of ribosome biogenesis-related genes for plant reproductive development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plastidic Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex E1 Component Subunit Alpha1 Is Involved in Galactolipid Biosynthesis Required for Amyloplast Development in Rice</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starch accounts for over 80% of the total dry weight in cereal endosperm and determines the kernel texture and nutritional quality. Amyloplasts, terminally differentiated plastids, are responsible for starch biosynthesis and storage. We screened a series of rice mutants with floury endosperm to clarify the mechanism underlying amyloplast development and starch synthesis. We identified the floury endosperm19 (flo19) mutant which shows opaque of the interior endosperm. Abnormal compound starch grains (SGs) were present in the endosperm cells of the mutant. Molecular cloning revealed that the FLO19 allele encodes a plastid-localized pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 component subunit α1 (ptPDC-E1-α1) that is expressed in all rice tissues. In vivo enzyme assays demonstrated that the flo19 mutant showed decreased activity of the plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In addition, the amounts of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) were much lower in the developing flo19 mutant endosperm, suggesting that FLO19 participates in fatty acid supply for galactolipid biosynthesis in amyloplasts. FLO19 overexpression significantly increased seed size and weight, but did not affect other important agronomic traits, such as panicle length, tiller number and seed setting rate. An analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data from a panel of rice accessions identified that the pFLO19L haplotype was positively associated with grain length, implying a potential application in rice breeding. In summary, our study demonstrates that FLO19 is involved in galactolipid biosynthesis which is essential for amyloplast development and starch biosynthesis in rice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organization and regulation of gene transcription</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulated transcription of genes determines cell identity and function. Recent structural studies have elucidated mechanisms that govern the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerases during the initiation and elongation phases. Microscopy studies have revealed that transcription involves the condensation of factors in the cell nucleus. A model is emerging for the transcription of protein-coding genes in which distinct transient condensates form at gene promoters and in gene bodies to concentrate the factors required for transcription initiation and elongation, respectively. The transcribing enzyme RNA polymerase II may shuttle between these condensates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Molecular principles are being defined that rationalize transcriptional organization and regulation, and that will guide future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A photoregulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptochromes (CRYs) are photoreceptors that mediate light regulation of the circadian clock in plants and animals. Here we show that CRYs mediate blue-light regulation of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) modification of more than 10% of messenger RNAs in the Arabidopsis transcriptome, especially those regulated by the circadian clock. CRY2 interacts with three subunits of the METTL3/14-type N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine RNA methyltransferase (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A writer): MTA, MTB and FIP37. Photo-excited CRY2 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to co-condense m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A writer proteins in vivo, without obviously altering the affinity between CRY2 and the writer proteins. mta and cry1cry2 mutants share common defects of a lengthened circadian period, reduced m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA methylation and accelerated degradation of mRNA encoding the core component of the molecular oscillator circadian clock associated 1 (CCA1). These results argue for a photoregulatory mechanism by which light-induced phase separation of CRYs modulates m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A writer activity, mRNA methylation and abundance, and the circadian rhythms in plants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: MAC5, an RNA-binding protein, protects pri-miRNAs from SERRATE-dependent exoribonuclease activities</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAC5 is a component of the conserved MOS4-associated complex. It plays critical roles in development and immunity. Here we report that MAC5 is required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. MAC5 interacts with Serrate (SE), which is a core component of the microprocessor that processes primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) into miRNAs and binds the stem-loop region of pri-miRNAs. MAC5 is essential for both the efficient processing and the stability of pri-miRNAs. Interestingly, the reduction of pri-miRNA levels in &lt;em&gt;mac5&lt;/em&gt; is partially caused by XRN2/XRN3, the nuclear-localized 5′-to-3′ exoribonucleases, and depends on SE. These results reveal that MAC5 plays a dual role in promoting pri-miRNA processing and stability through its interaction with SE and/or pri-miRNAs. This study also uncovers that pri-miRNAs need to be protected from nuclear RNA decay machinery, which is connected to the microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: Determinants of genome-wide distribution and evolution of uORFs in eukaryotes</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play widespread regulatory functions in modulating mRNA translation in eukaryotes, but the principles underlying the genomic distribution and evolution of uORFs remain poorly understood. Here, we analyze ~17 million putative canonical uORFs in 478 eukaryotic species that span most of the extant taxa of eukaryotes. We demonstrate how positive and purifying selection, coupled with differences in effective population size (Ne), has shaped the contents of uORFs in eukaryotes. Besides, gene expression level is important in influencing uORF occurrences across genes in a species. Our analyses suggest that most uORFs might play regulatory roles rather than encode functional peptides. We also show that the Kozak sequence context of uORFs has evolved across eukaryotic clades, and that noncanonical uORFs tend to have weaker suppressive effects than canonical uORFs in translation regulation. This study provides insights into the driving forces underlying uORF evolution in eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
