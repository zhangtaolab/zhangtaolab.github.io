        <title>Report: Unidirectional movement of small RNAs from shoots to roots in interspecific heterograf</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-distance RNA movement is important for plant growth and environmental responses; however, the extent to which RNAs move between distant tissues, their relative magnitude and functional importance remain to be elucidated on a genomic scale. Using a soybean (Glycine max)–common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grafting system, we identified 100 shoot–root mobile microRNAs and 32 shoot–root mobile phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), which were predominantly pro- duced in shoots and transported to roots, and, in most cases, accumulated to a level similar to that observed in shoots. Many of these microRNAs or phasiRNAs enabled cleavage of their messenger RNA targets or phasiRNA precursors in roots. In contrast, most mobile-capable mRNAs were transcribed in both shoots and roots, with only small proportions transported to recipient tissues. These findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms for small RNA movement are different from those for mRNA movement, and that the former is more strictly regulated and, probably, more functionally important than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: G-protein βγ subunits determine grain size through interaction with MADS-domain transcription factors in rice</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous improvement of grain quality and yield of cereal crops is a major challenge for modern agriculture. Here we show that a rice grain yield quantitative trait locus qLGY3 encodes a MADS-domain transcription factor OsMADS1, which acts as a key downstream effector of G-protein βγ dimers. The presence of an alternatively spliced protein OsMADS1&lt;sup&gt;lgy3&lt;/sup&gt; is shown to be associated with formation of long and slender grains, resulting in increases in both grain quality and yield potential of rice. The Gγ subunits GS3 and DEP1 interact directly with the conserved keratin-like domain of MADS transcription factors, function as cofactors to enhance OsMADS1 transcriptional activity and promote the co-operative transactivation of common target genes, thereby regulating grain size and shape. We also demonstrate that combining OsMADS1&lt;sup&gt;lgy3&lt;/sup&gt; allele with high-yield-associated dep1-1 and gs3 alleles represents an effective strategy for simultaneously improving both the productivity and end-use quality of rice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: Molecular Networks of Seed Size Control in Plants</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of seeds affects not only evolutionary fitness but also grain yield of crops. Understanding the mechanisms controlling seed size has become an important research field in plant science. Seed size is determined by the integrated signals of maternal and zygotic tissues, which control the coordinated growth of the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. Recent advances have identified several signaling pathways that control seed size through maternal tissues, including or involving the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, G-protein signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, phytohormone perception and homeostasis, and some transcriptional regulators. Meanwhile, growth of the zygotic tissues is regulated in part by the HAIKU (IKU) pathway and phytohormones. This review provides a general overview of current findings in seed size control and discusses the emerging molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks found to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: Identification of Plant Enhancers and Their Constituent Elements by STARR-seq in Tobacco Leaves</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering of cis-regulatory elements in crop plants is a promising strategy to ensure food security. However, such engineering is currently hindered by our limited knowledge of plant cis-regulatory elements. Here, we adapted self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)—a technology for the high-throughput identification of enhancers—for its use in transiently transformed tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves. We demonstrate that the optimal placement in the reporter construct of enhancer sequences from a plant virus, pea (Pisum sativum) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), was just upstream of a minimal promoter and that none of these four known enhancers was active in the 39 untranslated region of the reporter gene. The optimized assay sensitively identified small DNA regions containing each of the four enhancers, including two whose activity was stimulated by light. Furthermore, we coupled the assay to saturation mutagenesis to pinpoint functional regions within an enhancer, which we recombined to create synthetic enhancers. Our results describe an approach to define enhancer properties that can be performed in potentially any plant species or tissue transformable by Agrobacterium and that can use regulatory DNA derived from any plant genome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: Epigenetic reprogramming rewires transcription during the alternation of generations in Arabidopsis</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternation between morphologically distinct haploid and diploid life forms is a defining feature of most plant and algal life cycles, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern these transitions remain unclear. Here, we explore the dynamic relationship between chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications during life form transitions in Arabidopsis. The diploid-to-haploid life form transition is governed by the loss of H3K9me2 and DNA demethylation of transposon-associated cis-regulatory elements. This event is associated with dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional reprogramming. In contrast, the global loss of H3K27me3 in the haploid form shapes a chromatin accessibility landscape that is poised to re-initiate the transition back to diploid life after fertilisation. Hence, distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription through major reorganisation of the regulatory epigenome to guide the alternation of generations in flowering plants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: Chromatin Accessibility Dynamics and a Hierarchical Transcriptional Regulatory Network Structure for Plant Somatic Embryogenesis</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant somatic embryogenesis refers to a phenomenon where embryos develop from somatic cells in the absence of fertilization. Previous studies have revealed that the phytohormone auxin plays a crucial role in somatic embryogenesis by inducing a cell totipotent state, although its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that auxin rapidly rewires the cell totipotency network by altering chromatin accessibility. The analysis of chromatin accessibility dynamics further reveals a hierarchical gene regulatory network underlying somatic embryogenesis. Particularly, we find that the embryonic nature of explants is a prerequisite for somatic cell reprogramming. Upon cell reprogramming, the B3-type totipotent transcription factor LEC2 promotes somatic embryo formation by direct activation of the early embryonic patterning genes WOX2 and WOX3. Our results thus shed light on the molecular mechanism by which auxin promotes the acquisition of plant cell totipotency and establish a direct link between cell totipotent genes and the embryonic development pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Report: The relationship between genome structure and function</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise patterns of gene expression in metazoans are controlled by three classes of regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers and boundary elements. During differentiation and development, these elements form specific interactions in dynamic higher-order chromatin structures. However, the relationship between genome structure and its function in gene regulation is not completely understood. Here we review recent progress in this field and discuss whether genome structure plays an instructive role in regulating gene expression or is a reflection of the activity of the regulatory elements of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlantDHS&lt;/strong&gt; is a plant DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) database that integrates histone modification, RNA sequencing, nucleosome positioning/occupancy, transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), and genomic sequence within an easily navigated user interface. DHSs are indicative of all CREs, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and transcription factor binding sites.&lt;br /&gt;
PlantDHS provides a platform to predict all CREs associated with individual genes from three model plant species, including &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brachypodium distachyon&lt;/em&gt; and rice (&lt;em&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Popera</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A software specially designed for DHS identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/forrestzhang/Popera&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are regions of chromatin that are sensitive to cleavage by the DNase I enzyme. In these specific regions of the genome, chromatin has lost its condensed structure, exposing the DNA and making it accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Popera&lt;/strong&gt; is specially designed for identifying genome-wide DHSs from DNase-seq reads. First, Popera identifies the DHSs by applying the kernel density estimation algorithm. Second, all the DHSs identified from various tissues and developmental stages were merged to create a unified DHS file; DHSs were then assigned unique ID tags. Lastly, normalized scores of unified DHSs were calculated for each unique tissue and developmental stage. Besides, Popera can generate smooth bigwig files, which provide more explicit and pretty visualization for downstream analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
